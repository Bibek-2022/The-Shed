1000000,Gemma,Self-,Ferguson,Female,,Yes - Aboriginal,1985/05/03,498528875,elsie85@outlook.com,[Legal],1,Warringa Bahia Aboriginal Womens Legal Service - Family Law,Client Gemma Ferguson (who resides in Lake Cargelligo) was first referred to our service for assistance with a cultural plan for her children Jarad and Jaxon Calton. Ms Ferguson is currently before the Family Court in Lismore NSW in relation to her two children who are currently in the care of their non-Aboriginal paternal grandmother Veronica Porter in Braunstone NSW (approximately 25 min drive from Grafton NSW). A Family Report (Report No: (P)CRC28-2020) was conducted on 6 July 2020 by Nick Paris and ordered by Judge L Turner. We have not yet seen the report but we have asked Ms Ferguson to read it and identify whether there are any cultural consideration for the children. Ms Ferguson has advised us that she has read the report and there is no cultural content even though her legal representative Samantha Johnstone (Legal Aid Coffs Harbour) identified to the court that the children are indeed Aboriginal. Our concerns are that if the report remains the way it is and a judicial decision is made it will impact negatively on the childrens right to participate in their culture with people of their culture. In the family report Ms Ferguson identified that it reflects the grandmother Veronica Porter will keep Aboriginal culture up with them. We have major concerns as the grandmother is non-Aboriginal and the children do not reside on their Country being the land of the Ngiyaampaa people of Western NSW but on the lands of the Gumbaiynggirr people. We have sent an email request to Janet Carmichael (the President of Family Report Writers) asking that the report be re-done by a Family Consultant who is either Aboriginal or who is culturally competent. We have also requested that once the Cultural Plan is completed that it be a consideration of the family report. During an over-the-phone conversation with Ms Ferguson on 7 August 2020 she raised her concerns for the safety of her children as she has heard the father Mr Jay Calton in the background of her scheduled calls on a number of occasions although there are family law orders in place which prohibit Mr Calton to be at the childrens place of residence. Ms Ferguson has made numerous reports to DCJ and the Grafton Police with no response from either. Ms Ferguson mentioned that when contacting the police they make her feel little and tell her we cant keep doing this. Mr Calton was incarcerated due to domestic violence related offences inflicted on Ms Ferguson but he was released on 27 July 2020 due to the COVID-19 early release laws. Since his release Ms Ferguson has provided us with a screenshot of a threatening text sent by Mr Calton to her mobile phone. This has been provided to her lawyer Samantha Johnstone. Rick has sent another email to Gene Roche and Samantha from Legal Aid to arrange a Zoom meeting/ teleconference in relation to developing a Cultural Plan and the other issues that have come up. They include the threatening text by Mr Calton a subpoena to obtain Mr Caltons address childrens safety drug testing (hair follicle) and advice on Ms Fergusons current living circumstances and the impact on the courts decision. We have asked Ms Ferguson to notify Shaquille (from Wirringa Baiya) if she hears Mr Calton in the background of her call tonight (7 August 2020) between 7-7.30pm. Shaquille then will contact the police to undertake a welfare check. Shaquille is awaiting permission from her Coordinator if not Rick will do the follow up call.,7/08/2020 12:51,1001,0
